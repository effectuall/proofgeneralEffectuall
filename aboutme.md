### Purpose

The **3D interactive simulation** modules here, are developed to present the topics and concepts in 3D graphics for an in-depth learning experience. The platform uses 3D models that enables virtual-reality assessment of the formulae, laws and theories and allows to comprehend the concepts better.
All of the simulations in this site are created by me, **E.P Sajitha**. Please click on my name to send feedback about the simulation contents, visualisations or suggestions for new simulations.
More simulations' modules from Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Education are to be added at regular intervals.


The ensemble of Interactive Physics simulations in 3D are developed using open source [**Three.js-JavaScript 3D Library**](https://threejs.org/).
